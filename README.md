ðŸ”¥ DTEK8063 Firewall & IPS Technology Lab

This repository comprises the lab assignments I have completed for the DTEK8063 course, which pertain to firewall and IPS technology.
The Lab assignments.docx Word document contains my detailed solutions, configurations, and screenshots, while the PDFs (Firewall lab instructions Part 1 & 2) provide the original lab scenarios and requirements.

Contents

Official lab instructions (Part 1): V3.pdf - Firewall lab instructions.

Part 2 of the official lab instructions for the firewall lab is available in PDF format.

Lab assignments.docx â€“ My final solution, which includes network diagrams, Snort rules, firewall rules, and step-by-step configurations.

Technologies Employed

Firewalls: IPFire, pfSense

Snort on pfSense: IDS

Virtualisation: Oracle VirtualBox 7.1.4

Tools: Kali Linux, Metasploitable, Nmap, and Metasploit Framework

Highlights

pfSense and IPFire firewalls have been configured with routing, rules, and port forwarding.

Customised Snort IDS rules were implemented to detect exploits, ping sweeps, and port scanning.

Verified detection through Snort and conducted reconnaissance and exploitation using Nmap and Metasploit.

Generated network diagrams and documented step-by-step configurations to ensure reproducibility.

Notes

These solutions adhere to the official instructions and exhibit practical skills in the administration of firewalls, network security operations, and intrusion detection systems. Utilise them as a resource for comprehending real-world security configurations and incident management.
